Description

Write a program, to score a game of Ten-Pin Bowling.


The scoring rules:

Each game, or "line" of bowling, includes ten turns, 
or "frames" for the bowler.

In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to 
knock down all ten pins.

If the first ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins,
this is called a "strike". The frame is over. The score 
for the frame is ten plus the total of the pins knocked 
down in the next two balls.

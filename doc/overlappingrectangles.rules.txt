Description

Design a rectangle abstraction that supports the following operations:

- Constructed by parameters xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax (what happens if xmin is larger or equal to xmax? You decide what feels most natural..)
- Computing the Area and Circumference of the rectangle
- Checking if a rectangle overlaps another rectangles (does that mean they share points on the outline or inside? TDD is about design - so you decide!)

To run the Unit test you need to use: <code>phpunit</code> command from comand line.

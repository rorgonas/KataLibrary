<p>The 3 laws of TDD - Test Drive Development paradigm</p>
<ul>
	<li>You are not allowed to write any production code "unless" it is to make a failing test pass</li>		
	<li>You are not allowed to write any more of unit test than is "suficient to fail"</li>
	<li>You are not allowed to write any more production code than is "suficient to pass" one failing test</li>
</ul>

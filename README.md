Unit Testing
============

The 3 laws of TDD - Test Drive Development paradigm
* You are not allowed to write any production code "unless" it is to make a failing test pass
* You are not allowed to write any more of unit test than is "suficient to fail"
* You are not allowed to write any more production code than is "suficient to pass" one failing test
